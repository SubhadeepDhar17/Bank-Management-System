# Bank-Management-System

Hey everyone, So i just finished this project of creating a Bank Management System which lets you Login or Sign Up for a new bank account and then perform various  actions such as Deposit money, withdraw money, check banalance, pin change.

The entire project uses JAVA and JDBC conncetion with database on MySQL.
Here's how to run the project -

Step 1. Use your workspace, I use Eclipse to run the java files. 

Step 2. Run the SQL scripts on MySQL workbench

Step 3. Run 'Login.java' file.

I hope you find this fun and helpful.
